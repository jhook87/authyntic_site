- [x] Information not conveyed by color alone
- [x] Focus indicators have 3:1 contrast with background
- [x] Text can be resized to 200% without loss of functionality
- [x] No horizontal scrolling at 320px width

### Motion and Animation
- [x] Animations respect prefers-reduced-motion

## Tools and Methods

### Automated Testing
1. **axe DevTools** - Comprehensive WCAG compliance check
2. **WAVE** - Visual accessibility evaluation
3. **Lighthouse** - Performance and accessibility audit
4. **Pa11y** - Command-line accessibility testing

### Manual Testing
1. **Keyboard Navigation** - Navigate entire site with keyboard only
2. **Screen Reader** - Test with NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver
3. **Zoom Testing** - Test at 200% zoom
4. **Color Blindness** - Simulate protanopia, deuteranopia, tritanopia
5. **High Contrast Mode** - Test in Windows High Contrast Mode

### User Testing
1. **Keyboard-only users** - Users who cannot use a mouse
2. **Screen reader users** - Blind and low vision users
3. **Voice control users** - Users with motor impairments
4. **Cognitive disabilities** - Users with ADHD, dyslexia, etc.

## Accessibility Audit Results

## Known Issues and Remediation

### None Currently

## Best Practices

1. **Test Early and Often** - Integrate accessibility testing into development workflow
2. **Use Real Assistive Technology** - Automated tools catch ~30% of issues
3. **Include Diverse Users** - Test with people who have various disabilities
4. **Document Findings** - Track issues and resolutions
5. **Educate Team** - Train developers on accessibility standards
