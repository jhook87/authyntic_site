# Authyntic Design System Documentation

## Overview

The Authyntic design system merges DoD-level security standards with modern, consumer-friendly interfaces. This document outlines the visual hierarchy, security-focused components, and accessibility features that make the platform both secure and user-friendly.

## Core Principles

### 1. Security-First Design
Every UI element communicates trust and security without creating anxiety. Visual indicators are clear but not alarming, providing users with confidence in their actions.

### 2. Progressive Disclosure
Information is revealed progressively based on user context and security clearance. Trust levels are indicated visually through color and animation without overwhelming users.

### 3. Accessibility Excellence
The design system exceeds WCAG AAA standards, supporting multiple interaction methods and adaptive preferences.

## Color System

### Security State Colors
Designed using color psychology principles to convey appropriate urgency without panic:

- **Critical:** `#ff4560` - Security breaches, failed authentications
- **Warning:** `#ffc456` - Elevated risk, session expiring
- **Success:** `#3cf3c1` - Authenticated, verified, trusted
- **Info:** `#4c7dff` - Informational messages, system status
- **Neutral:** `#7a8cab` - Inactive states, pending processes

## Component Library

### Security Status Indicators
```html
<span class="security-status security-status--success">Authenticated</span>
```

### Trust Indicators
```html
<div class="trust-indicator trust-indicator--high">High Trust</div>
```

### Loading States
- Skeleton loaders for async content
- Loading spinners for active processes
- Button loading states with animations

### Form Validation
Real-time validation with visual feedback and ARIA support

### Password Strength Indicator
4-segment visual meter showing password security level

## Accessibility Features

- Enhanced focus indicators
- Skip links for keyboard navigation
- ARIA live regions for dynamic content
- Support for reduced motion preferences
- High contrast mode support
- 44x44px minimum touch targets

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Choose appropriate severity for security states
2. Provide context with color indicators
3. Use real-time validation for forms
4. Show clear authentication states
5. Honor user preferences (reduced motion, high contrast)
